/*
 * Browser impersonation: the ground-truth vectors of the design's 6.7, and the
 * NotSupportedException contract an impersonation profile owes on OpenSSL below 3.5 - see
 * notes/plans/http2-design.md 8.1 (D20)
 *
 * Sockets: loopback. OpenSSL 1.1.1w is deferred rather than tested - a case which needs it states
 * that flavor is owed (notes/plans/issues/openssl-1x-flavor-deferral.md)
 *
 * The module is devenv7+ only: the devenv7_only marker next to this file is what keeps it out of
 * the build on devenv2-6 (projects/make/common.mk). Headers never test BL_DEVENV_VERSION; they
 * guard on the capability they need - BOOST_VERSION, OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER - with a clear #error
 *
 * APPEND CONVENTION - read this before adding to this file
 * (notes/plans/http2-implementation-plan.md section 0)
 *
 *   A slice adds its own Test<Feature>.h in THIS directory and appends EXACTLY ONE #include line
 *   at the END of the include block below. It does not reorder, edit or remove another slice's
 *   line, and it does not include a test header from another module's directory
 *   (src/utests/AGENTS.md). Different slices then append different lines, so two lanes landing at
 *   once is a trivial merge rather than a conflict
 *
 *   Sibling files a slice may also add here: a notes.txt line carrying its --run_test= recipe,
 *   and a data/ file if it needs one - data/ is never shared between modules
